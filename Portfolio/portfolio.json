Crash into enemy cars to steal their caravans,  collect powerups to go fast or get drunk, see what hi-score you can get without before time runs out! <br><br> After the jam, we decided the game had been so fun to develop and adopted it into our weekly meetups. Since, pickups have been converted from 2D to 3D, new obstacles were added, and more!",

My engine was built on the concept of generic, flexible components, similar to the Unity framework. Gameplay programmers can add their own game objects, attaching both core and custom components to alter the behavior of and breathe context into the game object. This module focused on the underpinning programming patterns of a game engine, and the strengths/weaknesses of different approaches, along with a supporting commentary on how this can greatly affect the working environment of a large-scale development team.",
