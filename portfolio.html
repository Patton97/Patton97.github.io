          Currently working on "Dengar" as part of js13k 2019. The theme is "back", and the challenge
          is to keep the filesize below 13 kilobytes. My idea for Dengar is to have an 'endless' runner in reverse,
          where you play as an alien trying to return to Area 51. 
          <br>
          If you're seeing this before the competition deadline (13th September) then beware the game is still in progress!

        <p class="description">
          Started as a 'jam game' for GlobalGameJam, this is by far the most fun project 
          I've worked on to date. Myself and other members of Northumbria's Game Dev Society
          took the 2019 theme "What home means to you" and...well we ran with it.
          <br><br>
          Within the 48 hours of the jam, we focused on creating the spiritual successor to
          Snake that aboslutely nobody asked for. Crash into enemy cars to steal their caravans, 
          collect powerups to go fast or get drunk, see what hi-score you can get without before
          time runs out!
          <br><br>
          After the jam, we decided the game had been so fun to develop and adopted it into our
          weekly meetups. Since, pickups have been converted from 2D to 3D, new obstacles were added,
          and more!

          Forming the development side of my final year dissertation, this game acts as a
          learning tool for new programmers. Rather than being tasked with mundane data 
          processing programs, outputting countless variables to the console, they can
          now drive their very own Mars rover! Whilst this has now been submitted, I 
          plan to continue iterating upon it to see how far the program can go in terms of
          helping new programmers understand the fundamentals.

          Using C++ to extend a DirectX wrapper into a functional 2D game engine, applying an 
          optional advanced element. My engine was built on the concept of generic, flexible components, 
          similar to the Unity framework. Gameplay programmers can add their own game objects, attaching 
          both core and custom components to alter the behavior of and breathe context into the game 
          object. This module focused on the underpinning programming patterns of a game engine, and the 
          strengths/weaknesses of different approaches, along with a supporting commentary on how this can 
          greatly affect the working environment of a large-scale development team.

          As part of a 2-person project, we were tasked with created a 360° VR animation, using the THREE.js 
          library. As the directions for this were left open to allow for creativity and individuality, my 
          partner and I decided on a theme of a “Christmas Train”, with present-filled carriages and snow 
          falling into the user’s view. When the user taps on the screen, the simulation is stopped and they 
          are transported station-side.

          This game was made as part of a team project, with my focus being UI and Inventory. The player is tasked with 
          collecting components around the world to craft gun modules, enabling them to access different elements. These 
          elements can be equipped via a radial menu [Q], where the player is able to select two elements; a primary [RMB] 
          and a secondary [LMB].
