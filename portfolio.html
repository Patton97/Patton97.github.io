        <h2>Caravan Carnage Club</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Started as a 'jam game' for GlobalGameJam, this is by far the most fun project 
          I've worked on to date. Myself and other members of Northumbria's Game Dev Society
          took the 2019 theme "What home means to you" and...well we ran with it.
          <br>
          Within the 48 hours of the jam, we focused on creating the spiritual successor to
          Snake that aboslutely nobody asked for. Crash into enemy cars to steal their caravans, 
          collect powerups to go fast or get drunk, see what hi-score you can get without before
          time runs out!
          <br>
          After the jam, we decided the game had been so fun to develop and adopted it into our
          weekly meetups. Since, pickups have been converted from 2D to 3D, new obstacles were added,
          and more!

        <h2>CodeCraft</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Forming the development side of my final year dissertation, this game acts as a
          learning tool for new programmers. Rather than being tasked with mundane data 
          processing programs, outputting countless variables to the console, they can
          now drive their very own Mars rover! Whilst this has now been submitted, I 
          plan to continue iterating upon it to see how far the program can go in terms of
          helping new programmers understand the fundamentals.
